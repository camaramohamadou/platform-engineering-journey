# Contributing to This Project

This is a personal learning journey, but I welcome:

- 🐛 Bug reports
- 💡 Suggestions for improvement
- 📖 Documentation improvements
- 🤝 Collaboration on specific modules

## How This Repository Works

Each directory represents a learning module with:
- `README.md` - Module overview and goals
- `docs/` - Detailed explanations
- `src/` or code files - Actual implementation
- `tests/` - Validation scripts

## Philosophy

"Understand before you move" - Every piece of code should be:
1. Well-documented
2. Production-ready (not just tutorial code)
3. Reusable
4. Tested
