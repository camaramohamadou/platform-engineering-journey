## 🎯 Mission

Build production-ready internal developer platforms using Kubernetes, Terraform, and GitOps while documenting every step of the learning journey.

## 📖 About This Repository

This is my **living portfolio** documenting my transition from Senior Data Engineer (5x GCP certified) to Platform Engineer. Every project here is:
- ✅ **Production-ready** code, not tutorials
- ✅ **Well-documented** with architectural decisions
- ✅ **Reusable** by others learning the same path
- ✅ **Battle-tested** on real infrastructure

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

**"Understand before you move"**

Each module includes:
1. **Theory** - Why does this exist? What problem does it solve?
2. **Hands-on** - Build something real
3. **Documentation** - Explain it in my own words
4. **Testing** - Verify it works in production scenarios
